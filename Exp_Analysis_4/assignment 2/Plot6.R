# Exp_Analysis
# Project 2
# BY: Noura Azeem
# Date: April 11

# The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database 
# and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008. 
#You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

#Questions
# You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. 
# For each question/task you will need to make a single plot. Unless specified, 
# you can use any plotting system in R to make your plot.
library("ggplot2")

# Question 6 ----
#Compare emissions from motor vehicle sources in Baltimore City with emissions from motor vehicle sources in 
# Los Angeles County, California fips == "06037"
# Which city has seen greater changes over time in motor vehicle emissions?

# LA has had more change over time and though they are seeing a decrease from 2005- 2008, the 2008 value is still more
