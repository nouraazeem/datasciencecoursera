# Exp_Analysis
# Project 2
# BY: Noura Azeem
# Date: April 11

# The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database 
# and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008. 
#You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

#Questions
# You must address the following questions and tasks in your exploratory analysis. 
# For each question/task you will need to make a single plot. Unless specified, 
# you can use any plotting system in R to make your plot.
library("ggplot2")

NEI <- readRDS("summarySCC_PM25.rds")
SCC <- readRDS("Source_Classification_Code.rds")

# Question 1 ----
# Have total emissions from PM2.5 decreased in the United States from 1999 to 2008? 
# Using the base plotting system, make a plot showing the total PM2.5 emission from all sources for each of the 
# years 1999, 2002, 2005, and 2008.
